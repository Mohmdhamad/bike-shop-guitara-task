# Bike Shop — Guitara Task

A Flutter implementation of the Bike Store home screen, built to match the provided Figma design.

## Figma
Design reference: https://www.figma.com/design/fNh3ubhtVppfdrj2R23rUq/Online-Bike-Shopping-App--Community---Copy-?node-id=1-4

## Demo
- Responsive home screen built for mobile layouts.
- Clean architecture and reusable widgets.
- Smooth animations and accessible tap targets.

## Features
- Pixel-accurate UI matched to Figma as closely as possible.
- Responsive layout (works on different device sizes and orientations).
- Clean, well-structured code with separation of widgets and styles.
- Assets organized under assets/.
- README contains setup and running instructions.


## Requirements
- Flutter SDK >= 3.0.0
- Dart >= 2.17

## Setup & Run
1. Clone the repo:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohmdhamad/bike-shop-guitara-task.git
   cd bike-shop-guitara-task

2. Get dependencies:
   bash
   flutter pub get

3. Run on an emulator or device:
   bash
   flutter run


## Notes on implementation
- I focused on matching spacing, typography, colors, and layout from the Figma file.
- The layout uses flexible widgets and media-query based helpers to stay responsive.
- Code follows a simple, maintainable structure for easy extension.

## How to review
- Open the app on a phone-sized emulator (e.g., iPhone SE/Pixel 4).
- Compare screens to the Figma link above.
- Check lib/src/screens/home_screen.dart and lib/src/widgets/ for the main implementation.

## If you need changes
If you'd like adjustments (fonts, exact spacing tweaks, different breakpoints), tell me which screen/element and I’ll update promptly.
